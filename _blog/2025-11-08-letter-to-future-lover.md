**A Letter To You, in the Future**

Before I even know your name, I've already caught glimpses of your shadow in the seams of everyday life. Sometimes the evening breeze is so impossibly light, and I suddenly think: if you were here beside me, you would probably speak to me in that same gentle tone.

I don't know which season will bring us together. Perhaps a winter so long it makes one laugh, or perhaps beneath the faintly glowing branches of spring.

But I believe that however you come toward me, I will recognize you.

I will recognize you the way one recognizes a faint glow threaded through the cosmos, quiet and steady, pointing toward you.

If you're curious about the cosmos too, I'll tell you:

The brightest star in the winter night sky is Sirius. It lies 8.6 light-years away.

The brightness we see now began its journey over eight years ago.

You see, we haven't met yet, but the world has already prepared light for us in advance.

I think a lot. It's a habit I carry with me like a small key near my heart. Passing a tree, I'll stop and carefully choose a leaf, edges intact, veins distinct, like a miniature map. I'll press it into the little notebook I carry, and when I get home, I'll write down when I found it and what the weather was like. Then I'll save it for you. Someday, when we sit at the same table and you open that notebook, each leaf will restore the mood I felt that day.

I like handing you the scenery of my life. When I see flowers newly bloomed at a street corner, I pause and let that splash of color fall into my lens. When I see clouds quietly parting at the horizon, I feel that ray of light gently tapping my shoulder from afar. When I wander into a bookshop at the end of an alley and find a cat napping in a patch of sunlight, I can't help but bend down to remember for you the gentle rise and fall of its belly as it breathes.

I capture these unremarkable moments, and in each frame there's a thin thread reaching toward you. I imagine you looking at them—would you hear those hidden sounds too? The rustle of petals brushing air, the soft sound of light landing on the street, the low sweep of a cat's tail across an old wooden floor as it turns.

I save all of this in my phone. Each time I open it, I move my world half a step closer to you. I want you to see my eyes first, and then the view.

As a child, I loved making up stories, assigning roles to people who didn't exist, rehearsing little plays scene by scene. Later, they receded like the tide, and for a while I thought I had grown up. Now I know they never went far; they just retreated to a corner and waited. When I'm halfway through homework, daydreaming at a red light, or watching soup bubble on the stove, they quietly return. I hear the curtain being drawn open. When you meet me, I want to introduce you to these characters. It's my most secret theater, and I want to invite you to sit in the front row, to show you the stars and shadows I've carried with me since childhood.

I'm a little stubborn—you'll notice. I take forever choosing things. Before leaving the house, I pat my pockets for keys, tissues, earphones. Before speaking, I turn the words over in my mind. But my tenderness also hides in details: when I come across a beautiful line of poetry, I write it down to read to you on a day you're sad. While waiting in line at the supermarket, I'll pick out a box of yogurt you love but always forget to buy. Watching a movie, I'll imagine whether you'd laugh or frown at a certain scene, and I can't help wanting to tell you, "You'd definitely love this part." I seem like someone who can handle a lot, but when something big happens, I hesitate a little. I need just a bit of time. A cat tests the ground with its paw before landing; my steps, too, come a beat slower, a beat steadier. Please don't rush me. I'll come to you.

I also write letters to the future, to spring, to the rain, to cities we've never visited. When we finally go, I'll read that old letter aloud to you. You'll laugh; I'll blush. We'll try to find our way on unfamiliar street corners, miss one bus, then another, and on the third we'll sit by the window, seriously debating whether to get off and eat at that shop where sesame fragrance drifts out. You'll say east; I'll say west. You'll say two bowls; I'll say one bowl with extra cilantro. I'm willing to gather my heart into these small, ordinary things.

I still hold onto some childish wishes: I want to go to the sea with you, let the sound of waves wash our conversation down to nothing but laughter. I want to lie back and watch stars somewhere without light pollution, and actually see a shooting star, even just one. I want to travel somewhere neither of us has been, maybe a national park, maybe a small town barely visible on the map, and walk side by side through unfamiliar air for an entire road. I want to open an old book on some idle afternoon, read aloud the clumsy sentence I once wrote on the title page, then add a new line beneath it. Time, in our hands, will become two lines of writing, slowly drawing together until they meet.

We might argue. We might touch each other's softest places with our sharpest edges. Please know this: when I go quiet, it's because too many words have suddenly welled up inside me, and I can't pick one precise enough. I'm afraid saying it wrong will only make you sadder. I hope you can read the care behind my pauses. If you offer me one sincere word, I'll hand over all those tangled thoughts and show you where my true concern has been hiding. We'll both have moments when we can't speak. Neither of us is good at packaging feelings perfectly. But we can try, with each other, to slowly untie those knots.

Sometimes I ask myself: what kind of love do I long for? I think it's a meeting touched by fate. Countless tiny events in the universe travel along their own orbits, having nothing to do with one another, yet over vast stretches of time, two paths are drawn together by gravity until they finally land on the same point. We'll continue surging forward in each other's lives, illuminating them more brightly and more expansively.

Before you arrive, I still have so much to do. To keep my heart tender and my soul free.

To keep pushing myself toward wider places, to give my thoughts more open horizons. To read more books, meet more people. I want to gather up all the things I love along the way—all those bright ideas—and save them for you to see in the future. Every road I've walked, every struggle with myself and every victory, I'll keep carefully recorded, entry by entry, in my ledger. When you take my hand, I'll show you this account book, and you'll see how I grew into who I am today.

Perhaps right now you're busy building your own dreams, busy grappling with days still unknown. You don't yet know that a letter written for you lies folded in time, creased with small wishes by my hands. As I write, I wonder: in this moment before you've reached me, are you also making decisions about your future that only you know? Have you ever stopped on some evening, a flicker of inexplicable anticipation passing through your heart? In places I cannot see, you too are being shaped by your life, by the people you've met, the hurdles you've crossed, the wishes you've never spoken, pushed little by little toward the future.

When time finally agrees to give us to each other, we'll recognize one another as fate.

As I write this, a gust of wind falls past my window, as if someone has delivered my words to you ahead of time. I can't help imagining your expression as you read this: are you leaning against a train window, or sitting beneath a desk lamp? Is it a weary night, or a bright morning?

No matter. This letter will stay where you don't yet know. I've folded it and placed it on some future page.

I have so much more I want to tell you. When you stand before me, I'll say it all, slowly.

*—Written in the days before we meet*



Chinese Version:
致未来的你：

在我还不知道你的名字之前，我已经在日常生活的缝隙里，看见了你的一些影子。

晚风有时候轻得不像话，我会突然想，如果你此刻在身旁，大概会用同样轻柔的语气跟我说话。

我不知道我们会在哪个季节相遇。可能是在一个漫长得让人失笑的冬天，也可能是在春天微微泛光的枝条下。

但我想，无论你以什么方式走向我，我都会认得你。

我会认得你，就像认得一道在宇宙中微微发亮的轨迹，安静坚定指向你的方向。

如果你也对宇宙好奇，我会告诉你：

冬天夜空里最亮的那颗星叫天狼星，

它在八点六光年之外，

此刻我们眼中的亮度，早在八年多前踏上旅程。

你看，我们还没相遇，但世界已经提早为我们准备了光。

我常常想很多，这三个字像一把小钥匙，随身挂在我心口。路过一棵树，我会停下来，认真地挑一片叶子，边缘完整、叶脉清晰，像一张微缩的地图。我会把它夹进随身的小本子里，回到家写上遇见它的时间和天气，然后留给你。等我们在同一张桌子前，你打开本子，每一片叶子都能把我当天的心情还原出来。

我想要把生活里的景色递给你看。看到路口新开的花，我会停一下，让那一抹颜色落进镜头里；看到云层在天边悄悄裂开，我会觉得那道光在远处轻轻叩我的肩；走进巷子尽头的书店，看见一只猫窝在阳光里打盹，我会忍不住弯腰，替你记住它呼吸时微微起伏的肚皮。

我拍下这些不太惊人的时刻，每一个画面里都有一条细线向你延伸。我想象你在看它们时，会不会也听见那些隐匿的声音：花瓣碰触空气的沙沙，光落在街上的轻响，猫翻身时尾巴扫过旧木地板的低低一声。

我把这一切收入手机，每次点开，都把我的世界向你挪近半步。我想让你先看到我的眼睛，再看到风景。

小时候我爱编故事，给身边并不存在的人物分配角色，排练一场一场的小话剧。后来他们像退潮一样散去，我一度以为自己长大了。现在我知道，他们并没有走远，只是躲回到角落里等我。我写作业写到半途、等红灯等到发呆、把面汤煮到咕嘟时，他们会悄悄回来。我听见了幕布被拉开的声音。当你见到我，我想把这些角色介绍给你，那是我最隐秘的剧场，我想邀你坐在第一排，让你看看我那些从童年一路护送到现在的星星与影子。

我做事有点固执，你会看得出来。我挑东西会挑很久；出门前要摸一遍钥匙、纸巾、耳机；要开口之前会在心里把话翻上一遍。但是我的温柔也藏在细节里，看到一句好诗，我会记下来，等你某天难过时读给你听；超市排队时，我会给你挑一盒你爱吃但常忘买的酸奶；看电影到某个片段，我会想象你会不会笑，会不会皱眉，然后忍不住想告诉你“这个场景你一定会喜欢”。我看起来像能扛住很多事，但遇到大事时也会有点迟疑，我需要一点点时间。猫在落脚前会先探一下爪子，我的步伐也会慢一拍、稳一拍。你别催，我一定会走过来。

我也会写信给未来、给春天、给雨水、给我们没去过的城市。等到我们真的去了，我会把那封旧信念给你看。你笑着，我脸红着。我们会在陌生的街角认路，错过一班车，再错过一班车，然后在第三班车里靠窗坐着，认真讨论要不要下去吃那家飘着芝麻香的面。你说东，我说西，你说两碗，我说一碗多加香菜。我愿意在这些琐碎里把心收拢。

我还保留着一些幼稚的愿望：想和你去海边，让潮声把我们的对话冲得只剩笑意；想在没有光污染的地方仰头看星星，真的看见哪怕一颗流星；想找一个我们都没去过的地方旅行，可能是国家公园，可能是地图上不起眼的一个小镇，在陌生的空气里并排走上一整路；想在某个闲散的午后，翻开一本早年的书，把当时写在扉页上的笨拙句子读给你听，再在下面续上一句新的。时间在我们手里，会变成两行字，慢慢靠近连在一起。

我们可能会吵架，会用彼此最尖锐的部分触碰到对方最软的地方。你要知道，我偶尔沉默，是因为心里突然涌出太多话，挑不出哪一句够准确，怕说得不好让你更难过。我希望你能读懂我停顿背后的那份慎重，你若愿意递来一句真心，我会把那些绕来绕去的想法交给你，让你知道我真正的在意藏在哪里。我们都会有说不出口的瞬间，我们也都不擅长把感受整理得完美，可我们可以在彼此身上试着慢慢拆开那些结。

有时我会问自己：我向往怎样的爱？我想，大概是一场带着宿命色彩的相遇。宇宙里无数微小的事件正以各自的轨道前行，彼此毫不相干，可在漫长时间里，总有两条路径由引力牵向彼此，最终落在同一点上。我们会在对方的生命里继续往前涌，把彼此的生命照得更加辽亮。

你来之前，我还有好多事情要做。保持内心温柔而灵魂自由。

要把自己继续推向更广的地方，让思绪有更辽阔的去处，要多读一些书，多见一些人，我要把一路上遇见的喜欢都攒起来，把那些明亮的念头全部留到未来给你看。我走过的每一条路、每一次自我较量与通关，都会被我妥善保存，一笔一笔地入账，汇成我的存折。等你牵住我的手，我就把这本账本递给你看，你会知道我如何成长为今日的样子。

也许此刻的你正在忙著经营自己的理想，忙著和未知的日子交手。你还不知道有一封写给你的信正躺在时光里，被我用细小的愿望慢慢折好。我一边写着，一边会想：在你尚未抵达我的这个时刻，你是不是也在为自己的未来做一些只有你知道的决定；你是不是也曾在某个傍晚突然停下脚步，心里闪过一丝无法解释的期待。在我看不见的地方，你也正被你的人生塑造着，被你遇到的人、你跨过的坎、你未说出口的愿望一点点推向未来。

等到时间终于愿意把我们交给彼此，我们就以命运的姿态相认。

写到这里，窗外正落下一片风，仿似有人提前替我把话递给你。我忍不住想象你读到这里的眉眼：是靠在车窗边，还是在一盏台灯下？是在困倦的夜里，还是明亮的早晨？

无论如何，这封信先留在你不知道的地方。我把它折好，放在未来的某一页里。

我还有许多话想告诉你，等你站在我面前，我再慢慢和你说。

——写于我们尚未相逢的日子
