**A Letter To You, in the Future**

Before I even know your name, I've already caught glimpses of your shadow in the seams of everyday life. Sometimes the evening breeze is so impossibly light, and I suddenly think: if you were here beside me, you would probably speak to me in that same gentle tone.

I don't know which season will bring us together. Perhaps a winter so long it makes one laugh, or perhaps beneath the faintly glowing branches of spring.

But I believe that however you come toward me, I will recognize you.

I will recognize you the way one recognizes a faint glow threaded through the cosmos, quiet and steady, pointing toward you.

If you're curious about the cosmos too, I'll tell you:

The brightest star in the winter night sky is Sirius. It lies 8.6 light-years away.

The brightness we see now began its journey over eight years ago.

You see, we haven't met yet, but the world has already prepared light for us in advance.

I think a lot. It's a habit I carry with me like a small key near my heart. Passing a tree, I'll stop and carefully choose a leaf, edges intact, veins distinct, like a miniature map. I'll press it into the little notebook I carry, and when I get home, I'll write down when I found it and what the weather was like. Then I'll save it for you. Someday, when we sit at the same table and you open that notebook, each leaf will restore the mood I felt that day.

I like handing you the scenery of my life. When I see flowers newly bloomed at a street corner, I pause and let that splash of color fall into my lens. When I see clouds quietly parting at the horizon, I feel that ray of light gently tapping my shoulder from afar. When I wander into a bookshop at the end of an alley and find a cat napping in a patch of sunlight, I can't help but bend down to remember for you the gentle rise and fall of its belly as it breathes.

I capture these unremarkable moments, and in each frame there's a thin thread reaching toward you. I imagine you looking at them—would you hear those hidden sounds too? The rustle of petals brushing air, the soft sound of light landing on the street, the low sweep of a cat's tail across an old wooden floor as it turns.

I save all of this in my phone. Each time I open it, I move my world half a step closer to you. I want you to see my eyes first, and then the view.

As a child, I loved making up stories, assigning roles to people who didn't exist, rehearsing little plays scene by scene. Later, they receded like the tide, and for a while I thought I had grown up. Now I know they never went far; they just retreated to a corner and waited. When I'm halfway through homework, daydreaming at a red light, or watching soup bubble on the stove, they quietly return. I hear the curtain being drawn open. When you meet me, I want to introduce you to these characters. It's my most secret theater, and I want to invite you to sit in the front row, to show you the stars and shadows I've carried with me since childhood.

I'm a little stubborn—you'll notice. I take forever choosing things. Before leaving the house, I pat my pockets for keys, tissues, earphones. Before speaking, I turn the words over in my mind. But my tenderness also hides in details: when I come across a beautiful line of poetry, I write it down to read to you on a day you're sad. While waiting in line at the supermarket, I'll pick out a box of yogurt you love but always forget to buy. Watching a movie, I'll imagine whether you'd laugh or frown at a certain scene, and I can't help wanting to tell you, "You'd definitely love this part." I seem like someone who can handle a lot, but when something big happens, I hesitate a little. I need just a bit of time. A cat tests the ground with its paw before landing; my steps, too, come a beat slower, a beat steadier. Please don't rush me. I'll come to you.

I also write letters to the future, to spring, to the rain, to cities we've never visited. When we finally go, I'll read that old letter aloud to you. You'll laugh; I'll blush. We'll try to find our way on unfamiliar street corners, miss one bus, then another, and on the third we'll sit by the window, seriously debating whether to get off and eat at that shop where sesame fragrance drifts out. You'll say east; I'll say west. You'll say two bowls; I'll say one bowl with extra cilantro. I'm willing to gather my heart into these small, ordinary things.

I still hold onto some childish wishes: I want to go to the sea with you, let the sound of waves wash our conversation down to nothing but laughter. I want to lie back and watch stars somewhere without light pollution, and actually see a shooting star, even just one. I want to travel somewhere neither of us has been, maybe a national park, maybe a small town barely visible on the map, and walk side by side through unfamiliar air for an entire road. I want to open an old book on some idle afternoon, read aloud the clumsy sentence I once wrote on the title page, then add a new line beneath it. Time, in our hands, will become two lines of writing, slowly drawing together until they meet.

We might argue. We might touch each other's softest places with our sharpest edges. Please know this: when I go quiet, it's because too many words have suddenly welled up inside me, and I can't pick one precise enough. I'm afraid saying it wrong will only make you sadder. I hope you can read the care behind my pauses. If you offer me one sincere word, I'll hand over all those tangled thoughts and show you where my true concern has been hiding. We'll both have moments when we can't speak. Neither of us is good at packaging feelings perfectly. But we can try, with each other, to slowly untie those knots.

Sometimes I ask myself: what kind of love do I long for? I think it's a meeting touched by fate. Countless tiny events in the universe travel along their own orbits, having nothing to do with one another, yet over vast stretches of time, two paths are drawn together by gravity until they finally land on the same point. We'll continue surging forward in each other's lives, illuminating them more brightly and more expansively.

Before you arrive, I still have so much to do. To keep my heart tender and my soul free.

To keep pushing myself toward wider places, to give my thoughts more open horizons. To read more books, meet more people. I want to gather up all the things I love along the way—all those bright ideas—and save them for you to see in the future. Every road I've walked, every struggle with myself and every victory, I'll keep carefully recorded, entry by entry, in my ledger. When you take my hand, I'll show you this account book, and you'll see how I grew into who I am today.

Perhaps right now you're busy building your own dreams, busy grappling with days still unknown. You don't yet know that a letter written for you lies folded in time, creased with small wishes by my hands. As I write, I wonder: in this moment before you've reached me, are you also making decisions about your future that only you know? Have you ever stopped on some evening, a flicker of inexplicable anticipation passing through your heart? In places I cannot see, you too are being shaped by your life, by the people you've met, the hurdles you've crossed, the wishes you've never spoken, pushed little by little toward the future.

When time finally agrees to give us to each other, we'll recognize one another as fate.

As I write this, a gust of wind falls past my window, as if someone has delivered my words to you ahead of time. I can't help imagining your expression as you read this: are you leaning against a train window, or sitting beneath a desk lamp? Is it a weary night, or a bright morning?

No matter. This letter will stay where you don't yet know. I've folded it and placed it on some future page.

I have so much more I want to tell you. When you stand before me, I'll say it all, slowly.

*—Written in the days before we meet*
