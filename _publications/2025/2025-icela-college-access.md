  Higher education is a crucial pathway for social mobility and economic growth. College access for low-income students has thus gained major attention. This study examines U.S. policies supporting college readiness for children from low-income backgrounds. Findings show these policies effectively expand educational opportunities. They establish support systems, implement long-term tracking, and promote cross-sector collaboration. The impact appears in higher college enrollment rates. Policies also shift educational perceptions and improve intergenerational mobility among low-income families. However, the burden of complexity in policy implementation and systemic imbalances in resource allocation limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, this study suggests two main strategies: creating a differentiated empowerment framework and developing streamlined, transparent policy designs. These measures aim to improve policy impact through institutional innovation. Findings offer theoretical and practical insights to rebuild educational support systems, promote educational equity, and advance social mobility.
